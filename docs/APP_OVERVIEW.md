# VOiD — Be visible to friends. Invisible to machines.

**VOiD** is a next-generation privacy camera app designed for the AI era. It allows you to share photos on social media without feeding the algorithms that track you.

## The Problem: You Are Being Watched

Every photo you upload to the internet—Instagram, LinkedIn, dating apps—is scraped by facial recognition companies (like Clearview AI) and tech giants. They build a permanent digital profile of you: where you go, who you know, and what you do.

Even if you delete your account, your biometric data remains in their databases forever.

## The Solution: Digital Camouflage

VOiD applies a mathematically calculated "adversarial perturbation" to your photos.

- **To Human Eyes:** The photo looks perfect. High quality, sharp, unchanged.
- **To AI Algorithms:** The photo is "noise". The facial recognition software sees nothing, or identifies you as a completely different person (e.g., a random celebrity or object).

It is an invisibility cloak for the 21st century.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Does this make my photo look blurry?**
No. The changes are "imperceptible perturbations". They are tiny changes to specific pixels that humans ignore but computers rely on. Your photo remains sharp and beautiful.

**Can I use this for existing photos?**
Yes. You can import any photo from your gallery into VOiD to "scrub" it before posting online.

**Is this legal?**
Absolutely. You have the right to privacy and the right to modify your own creative works (your photos) to protect your biometric data.
